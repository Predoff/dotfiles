## Oh My ZSH

I use [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) to costumize my Z Shell config.

## VIMFILES

My Vim configuration files. Originally forked from user [@reu](http://github.com/reu).

## Instalation

1. `git clone https://github.com/predoff/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
2. `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.dotfiles/vimfiles/bundle/vundle`
3. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
4. `make install`
5. Run Vim and type `:BundleInstall`

Also, if you want to unleash the full beauty of powerline, you will need to install a custom patched font. You can download some of them [here](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline).
